// Ownership: set of rules that RUST manages memory
// Stack and Heap is kind of memory storage of the system
// Data in stack: must have known and fixed size 
// Data in heap: allow an unknown size at compile or a size that might change

// pushing data: stack faster than heap ; no allocating step in stack
// accessing data: stack faster than heap ; heap need to follow pointer but stack not 

fn main() {
    // ownerships rules
    // - each value in Rust has an owner
    // - there can only be one owner at a time

    }                            // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid

    // which mean we just copy the ptr from s1 to s2 ptr

                              // if s1 still valid then it will cause double free memory
                              //  when s1, s2 go out of scope
    // so in Rust it called s1 was 'move' to s2 -> s1 moved then s1 no longer valid
